# Tiny Tapeout Verilog Project Template

- [Read the documentation for project](docs/info.md)
- This project is a part of the BWSI Basics of ASICs 2025 (Team - ASIC Beaver Hunters: Aria Mitra, Adam Y, Beverly Jin, Alex M, Sahana Hebbar, An-Jie Yu, Hannah Wang)
- Contact Info (let us know if it works for you!): ariamitra99@yahoo.com, hannahbananainmontana11@gmail.com, bjsnw1gm@gmail.com
- It is a sound manipulator that can change the octave up or down and incorporate a tremolo. These effects can be layered. It also should create a LED blinking in time with the frequency of the sound.
- The inputs are clk1 (the sound), clk2 (an auxilary input for the tremolo), octave_dena (octave down enable), octave_uena (octave up enable), tremolo_ena (tremolo enable), led_ena (led enable)
- The outputs are out_full (all sound outputs whether or not effects are layered) and led_out (for the LED display).
- An insight we had was that sound based products require a lot of external hardware which makes doing projects like a stylophone etc. hard to do just using a chip.

## What is Tiny Tapeout?

Tiny Tapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Set up your Verilog project

1. Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder.
2. Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and update information about your project, paying special attention to the `source_files` and `top_module` properties. If you are upgrading an existing Tiny Tapeout project, check out our [online info.yaml migration tool](https://tinytapeout.github.io/tt-yaml-upgrade-tool/).
3. Edit [docs/info.md](docs/info.md) and add a description of your project.
4. Adapt the testbench to your design. See [test/README.md](test/README.md) for more information.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).
